        I am a software engineer who love to flex and hope that A.I. can not
        replace my jobs. Sleeping is my favorite hobby, I coded because It's
        cool and bring wealthy to this era.

        When I'm not coding, you can find me on the bed or playing games with my
        friends. LMAO All the sections I used GitHub Copilot to write, so I
        don't need to write much.
